# PostgreSQL + Node.js Learning Project

Welcome to my learning project! This repository contains code and examples where I am learning how to use **PostgreSQL** and **Node.js** together in a practical way. The main goal of this project is to practice and understand the concepts of databases and server-side programming in a real-world style project.

## 🌟 Project Overview

In this project, I am exploring:

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Table creation and data management
  - Queries, joins, and relationships
  - Working with environment variables for database connection

- **Node.js**:
  - Setting up a backend server using **Express.js**
  - Connecting Node.js with PostgreSQL
  - Handling API requests and responses
  - Using TypeScript for type safety
  - Using `ts-node` and `nodemon` for faster development

## ⚡ Features

- Simple server setup with Node.js and Express
- PostgreSQL database integration
- TypeScript support for better code structure
- Automatic server restart using `nodemon`
- Clean project structure for learning purposes
